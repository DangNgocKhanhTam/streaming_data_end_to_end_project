# Real-Time Data Pipeline with Kafka, Spark, and Airflow
## **Overview**
This project involves designing a real-time data pipeline with Kafka and Spark Streaming. Stock price data is streamed from a custom Market API and stored in MongoDB. A daily workflow, managed with Apache Airflow, extracts details about stock prices and loads them into a PostgreSQL database. Using this daily data, I produce a concise report highlighting key stock statistics.
## Market API
